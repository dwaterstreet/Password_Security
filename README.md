# Password_Security
This script runs a criteria match for an inputted password.
  Inspired from example in "Introduction to Python Programming for Business and Social Science Applications" with editted UI, additional error messages, 
    and different perameters
    
This script was useful in my comprhension of loops, if statements, and just overall logical progression
